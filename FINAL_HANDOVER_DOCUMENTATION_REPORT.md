# FINAL HANDOVER DOCUMENTATION REPORT

## Repository
- **Branch:** `master`
- **Latest commit:** `d979754` (docs: finalize API documentation and Postman collection)
- **Working tree:** Clean

## README
**PASS** — Updated with:
- Employee/Auth frontend contract section (15/15 APIs)
- Current test results (135 tests, 40 suites, all passing)
- Railway status (Prepared, not Deployed)
- Reference to EMPLOYEE_AUTH_API.md
- Postman collection link
- Updated project structure (auth/ now includes logout-all, devices/ now includes approve/reject/block)

## API Documentation
**PASS** — `EMPLOYEE_AUTH_API.md` (380 lines) reflects actual backend:
- POST /api/auth/login (with device fingerprint, pending approval, blocked)
- GET /api/auth/me (employee/role/permissions/notifications/shift/device)
- POST /api/auth/refresh (token_type, expires_in, refresh_expires_in)
- POST /api/auth/logout
- POST /api/auth/logout-all
- GET/POST /api/users (with workStart/workEnd)
- GET /api/users/:id (with auditLogs, attendanceRecords, pageAccess)
- PUT /api/users/:id (with workStart/workEnd mapping)
- PUT /api/users/:id/page-access
- GET /api/employees/:id/devices (mapped response)
- PUT /api/employees/:id/devices/:deviceId/{approve,reject,block}

## Postman
**PASS** — Collection synced:
- Login test script fixed: `res.data.token` → `res.data.auth.access_token`
- Cashier login test script fixed: same fix
- Added 8 new endpoints: Get Me, Refresh Token, Logout, Logout All Devices, Update Page Access, Get User Attendance, Employee Devices (list/approve/reject/block)
- Added variables: `refreshToken`, `employeeId`, `deviceId`
- Added Health Ready and Health Live endpoints
- Updated description with variable documentation

## Tests

**135 tests, 40 suites, all passing — across 11 test files.**

No regressions introduced by documentation changes.

## Employee/Auth
**15/15 engineer-required APIs aligned** — verified via test suite.

## Railway
**Prepared for Railway deployment** — No live Railway URL exists. Deployment guide available in `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`.

## Security
**PASS** — No secrets, passwords, JWT keys, Railway tokens, or API keys in diff. `.env` not tracked in git. `.env.example` uses placeholder values.

## Files Changed

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `docs/404-coffee.postman_collection.json` | Fixed login script, added 8 endpoints, added variables |
| `README.md` | Added Employee/Auth section, test results, Railway status |
| `FINAL_HANDOVER_REPORT.md` | Updated commit, test counts, Employee/Auth table |
| `FINAL_API_RECONCILIATION.md` | Added logout-all, employee device routes, attendance |

d979754 docs: finalize API documentation and Postman collection
```
Pushed to `origin/master`.

## Remaining Work

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Railway deployment | Medium | Prepared but not deployed — manual steps required |
| auth_sessions table with hashed refresh tokens | Low | Backend architectural change, doesn't affect API contract |
| sessionId/deviceId in JWT payload | Low | Backend architectural change |
| 14 missing Excel endpoints | Low | All classified as OPTIONAL or BLOCKED by infrastructure |
| Dead WebSocket events cleanup | Low | Cosmetic, no functional impact |
